Recovery

This approach does not require a lot of checks during the work of the CPU.
If significant number of processes will be deadlocked the utilization of the
CPU will decrease, the system will detect it, find deadlocked processes and kill
some of them to solve the problem. To conclude, it is not difficult to implement
but not really effecive. It can be better than others if deadlocks in our system
is rare.


Prevention

Good approach which is used in real systems. It is implemented via attacking for conditions
of deadlock appearance. If we want to construct effective system combination of prevention 
and recovery can be used.


Avoidance

Avoidance can be effectively used in systems where we can know needs of processes
in advance. In such a case we can apply for example the Banker's Algorithm and avoid
deadlocks if it is possible. To conclude, avoidance is not working model for real systems.
